# Week1

A simple endless runner game where you play as a red cube with green obstacles spawning in front of you. You use the A and D keys or Left and Right keys to move side to side to dodge the obstacles. The game continues until you hit one of the obstacles. Every 10 obstacles you pass will increase the speed at which the obstacles come towards you.
